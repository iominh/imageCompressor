## Image Compressor

### About

This is a shell script that will run ImageMagick's "convert" program on 
all of the jpg files in a directory. Please ensure that [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) is installed and available on the command, otherwise this script will
not work. 

### Run

*    sh compressImages.sh <directory>
