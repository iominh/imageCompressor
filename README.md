## Image Compressor

### About

This is a shell script that will run ImageMagick's "convert" program on 
all of the jpg files in a directory. Please ensure that [http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php](ImageMagick) is installed and available on the command, otherwise this script will
not work. 

### Run
